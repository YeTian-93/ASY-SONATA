The main function is validate.m;  LASSO_Data_Gen.m is used to generated the problem
data and directed_graph_generator.m is to generate a directed graph;  data.mat and
directed_graph.mat provides instances of the problem data and the directed graph 
respectivelyi; ASYDSCA.m encapsulates our algorithm; result_LASSO_directed.mat
is the result data obtained by running validate.m
