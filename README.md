# ASY-SONATA

This is the MATLAB code for simulating ASY-SONATA.  The simulation consists of three problems and includes comparison with state of arts that can be implemented in the partial asynchronous model [1] and over directed graphs.  We elaborate below some basic setups:

### asynchronous model:
> + *Activation lists* are generated by concatenating *random rounds*.  A random round is either a random shuffle of all agents or is generated in the following way: we first sample its length uniformly from the interval $[Num_Nodes, time_window]$, with some specified $time_window$;  within a  round, we first have each agent appearing exactly once and then sample agents uniformly for the remaining spots;  finally a random shuffle of the agents order is performed on each round.
> + Each transmitted message  has  (integer) *traveling time* which is sampled uniformly from the interval $[0, D^{\text{tv}}]$, with some specified $D^{\text{tv}}$.

Agents wake up according to an activation list.  An agent will send out information to all its out-neighbors immediately after it finishes its own local update.  Suppose $T_{ij}^k$ is the traveling time of a packet sent from agent $j$ at the virtual global iteration $k$.  The packet will not be available to $i$ until the virtual global iteration $k+T_{ij}^k.$  Every agent always uses the most recently generated information from its in-neighbors out of those available.
